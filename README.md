# Latent Diffusion for Geomodel Parameterization

Code example for "Latent diffusion models for parameterization and data assimilation of facies-based geomodels"[ARXIV LINK]

## Summary
We present a deep-learning geological parameterization for complex facies-based geomodels, using recently developed generative latent diffusion models (LDMs), first published by [Rombach et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752). Diffusion models are trained to ''denoise'', which enables them to generate new geological realizations from input fields characterized by random noise. Based on Denoising Probabilstic Diffusion Models (DDPMs), introduced by [Ho et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239), the LDM representation reduces the number of variables to be determined during history matching, while preserving realistic geological features in posterior models. The model developed in this work includes a variational autoencoder (VAE) for dimension reduction, a U-net for the denoising process, and a Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM, [Song et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02502)) noise scheduling for inference.
\

Our application involves conditional 2D three-facies (channel-levee-mud) systems. The LDM can provide realizations that are visually consistent with samples from geomodeling software. General agreement between the diffusion-generated models and reference realizations can be observed through quantitative metrics involving spatial and flow-response statistics. The smoothness of the parameterization method can be assessed through latent-space interpolation tests. The LDM can then used for ensemble-based data assimilation. Significant uncertainty reduction, posterior P<sub>10</sub>-P<sub>90</sub> forecasts that generally bracket observed data, and consistent posterior geomodels, can be achieved.

## Contents
- `scripts/` - Directory to store dataset for data preparation, variational autoencoder (VAE) training and U-net training `.py` scripts.
- `data/` - Directory to store training dataset used in this study (2D, three-facies channelized geomodels). Dataset is stored as datasets.Dataset folder (`diffusers_dataset/`) 
- `testing/` - Directory to store reference (geomodeling software-generated) `m_petrel_200.npy` and LDM-generated `m_ldm_200.npy` ensembles used for flow simulations and history matching. Synthetic "true" models used in history matching are saved as `m_true_1.npy` and `m_true_2.npy`. Both are stored as `.npy` files.

Code implementations are based on the following repositories:
- [diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/)
- [monai](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/tree/main/generative)

## Software requirements
Running the scripts requires the libraries `datasets`,  `diffusers`,  `monai` or  `monai-generative`.
\
This workflow is tested with Python 3.9 and PyTorch 1.8 (CPU/GPU).
